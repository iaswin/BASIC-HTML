            <h1>HTML</h1>
            <P>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a programming language used to create and structure content for the web. It forms the foundation of all websites and is used to create everything from simple static pages to complex web applications.

                Here are some key concepts to help you get started with HTML:
                
                Tags: HTML is made up of tags, which are surrounded by angle brackets (< and >). Tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. For example, the <html> tag defines the beginning and end of an HTML document.
                
                Elements: Elements are made up of one or more tags and the content between them. For example, the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph, and the text between the opening and closing <p> tags is the content of the paragraph.
                
                Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about an element, and are added to the opening tag. For example, the <img> tag is used to insert an image into a web page, and the src attribute specifies the location of the image file.</P>

            <h1>CSS</h1>
            <P>CSSCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style web pages. It allows developers to control the presentation of HTML elements, such as the layout, colors, fonts, and more. CSS is a critical component of web development, as it enables developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</P>
